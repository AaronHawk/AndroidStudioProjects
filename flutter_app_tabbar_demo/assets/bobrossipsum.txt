How do you make a round circle with a square knife? That's your challenge for the day. In your world you can create anything you desire. A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him.

I was blessed with a very steady hand; and it comes in very handy when you're doing these little delicate things. I thought today we would do a happy little picture. Every time you practice, you learn more. The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow.

Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain. I think there's an artist hidden in the bottom of every single one of us. All kinds of happy little splashes. These things happen automatically. All you have to do is just let them happen. There it is. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there.

Each highlight must have it's own private shadow. We'll throw some old gray clouds in here just sneaking around and having fun. Almost everything is going to happen for you automatically - you don't have to spend any time working or worrying.

It's a good way of getting rid of all your anxieties and hostilities. If what you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're doing the wrong thing. Let's get wild today. Now let's put some happy little clouds in here.

It's hard to see things when you're too close. Take a step back and look. If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path. It all happens automatically. It is a lot of fun. Son of a gun. If there's two big trees invariably sooner or later there's gonna be a little tree.

There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature. The shadows are just like the highlights, but we're going in the opposite direction. Mix your color marbly don't mix it dead. There we go.
